# CS405 HW1: Games  

## Description  
Goal: Write a game of Checkers that is compatible with several different types of intelligent agents.

## Features  
### Agents  
* Stochastic: Optimized random move agent. Will move pieces but without a goal.
* Breadth First Search: Utilizes BFS to find the best next move.
* Depth First Search: Utilizes DFS to find the best next move.
* Evolutionary: Use evolutionary algoritms to find the next best move.
* Alpha Beta: Utilizes Alpha Beta pruning to be a defensive agent.

## Progress  
UI loads and runs successfully and as intended (should probably do something about the script error at some point). Stochastic agent has been implemented and seems to be running as it should. Other agents need to be implemented yet, but may require a rework of how moves are handled.
